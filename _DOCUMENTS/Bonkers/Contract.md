**2.  PLANNING**
**2.1 Regular SCRUM Board Updates:**
In order to ensure that everyone on the team is aware of the current status of each task, it is important to update the SCRUM board every time a task's status changes.  This includes updating the status of completed tasks, as well as any changes in priority or deadlines.

**2.2 Breaking down Tasks:**
To ensure that each task is manageable and that progress can be made consistently, it is important to split tasks into the smallest possible chunks. 
This helps to avoid overwhelm and ensure that each task is completed efficiently.

**2.3 In-Person Stand-Up Meetings:**
As a team, we will schedule at least one in-person stand-up meeting every week. 
This allows us to discuss progress, any obstacles or challenges, and plans for the coming week.

**2.4 Updating the SCRUM Board:**
At every stand-up meeting, the team will update the to-do section of the SCRUM board using tasks from the backlog. This ensures that the team stays on track and that everyone is aware of the tasks that need to be completed.

**2.5 Prototyping:**
To ensure that we can test early and iterate as necessary, we will aim to create a prototype as quickly as possible. This allows us to identify any issues or challenges early on and adjust our plans accordingly.

**2.6 Sprint Length:**
Each sprint will be two weeks long. This allows us to make consistent progress while also ensuring that we have regular opportunities to reassess and adjust our plans.

**2.7 Builds:**
At the end of every sprint there has to be a new functioning build with all the working features/prototypes in it up until that point. This will be presented to the entire team so everyone knows what the current state of the project is like.

**2.8 Testing:**
At the beginning of each new sprint, we will test everything that has been completed up to that point. This ensures that we catch any issues early and can make adjustments as needed.

**2.9 Manageable Scope:**
During sprint planning phases, it's important to bear in mind that this project allots only 5 European Credits (EC) per academic block. One European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credit corresponds to 28 hours of combined school and home-based work, resulting in a total workload of 140 hours per individual over the entire block period.
Our commitment is to maintain a manageable project scope that does not necessitate working on weekends or holidays. This approach is designed to promote a healthy work-life balance within the team, enabling us to sustain consistent progress while preventing burnout.

**3.  COMMUNICATION**
**3.1 Effective Communication:**
Effective communication is the key to ensuring that all team members are on the same page. To achieve this, all team members should make sure that they are being clear and understood by asking questions if necessary. If a team member does not understand something, they should not hesitate to ask for clarification.

**3.2 Regular Updates:**
To ensure a smooth workflow, all team members should keep others informed about their progress and any changes in their plans. This is especially important when it affects other team members. It is important to update the SCRUM board and notify others immediately when there are any significant changes in planning.

**3.3 Visual Communication:**
Visual representation is a powerful tool for communication. To ensure that ideas are conveyed clearly, the team should use visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes. These visual aids can help to communicate complex ideas more efficiently than words alone.

**3.4 Feedback:**
Feedback is critical in ensuring the quality of the game. Every completed task should be reviewed by respective leads, and additional feedback should be sought from other team members. It is important to consider and incorporate feedback in the next iteration of the task to ensure the best possible outcome.

**3.5 Game Design Document:**
The game design document (GDD) is a vital part of the game development process. It should contain all the necessary information about the game, such as the concept, mechanics, levels, and characters.  
It is the responsibility of every team member to work on and update the GDD. The lead designer should oversee the GDD, but it is the team's responsibility to ensure that it is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the game.  
All changes to the GDD should be communicated to the team to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.

**3.6 Attitude and Behaviour**
All team members are expected to maintain a professional attitude and behaviour during work sessions. This includes but is not limited to: Being respectful, willing to collaborate, general conduct, and being able to take feedback into account.

**4.3.1 Proper Use of Source Control:**
The source control system must be set up and used properly by all team members. This ensures that no work is lost due to human error or incompetence. Any member who fails to comply with this rule will be held accountable for any loss of work or delays.

**4.3.2 Naming Conventions:**
All assets must be named properly and follow the agreed-upon naming conventions. This makes it easier for team members to find and work on specific assets.

**4.3.3 Branching Strategy:**
The team must agree on a branching strategy for the source control system. This strategy must be followed to prevent conflicts and ensure that the latest version of the project is always available to all team members.

**4.3.4 Backup Procedures:**
The team must agree on backup procedures for the source control system. These procedures must include periodic backups and offsite backups to prevent data loss in case of system failure or disasters, in our case that means pushing to GitHub and uploading and making release builds.

**4.3.5 Access Control:**
Access to the source control system must be controlled and limited to authorized team members only. The lead developer is responsible for granting access to team members and ensuring that access is revoked when team members leave the project.

----

**5.  DEADLINES**
**5.1 Project Milestones:**
The project will be divided into several milestones, with each milestone having a specific deadline. These deadlines must be agreed upon by all team members and included in the project schedule. Any delays in meeting these deadlines must be communicated to the designated lead as soon as possible.

**5.2 Milestone Completion:**
Each milestone must be completed on or before its designated deadline. The designated lead will review the completion of each milestone and ensure that all requirements have been met before the project can proceed to the next milestone.

**5.3 Final Delivery:**
The final delivery of the project must be made on or before the agreed-upon deadline. All assets and content must be complete, reviewed, and checked into source control, and the project must be functional and ready for deployment. Any delays in delivery must be communicated to the respective leads as soon as possible.

**5.4 Late Delivery:**
If the project is delivered after the agreed-upon deadline, the leads have the right to impose penalties or terminate the contract.  
Where applicable the team member will be held responsible for any financial loss or damages incurred by the team due to late delivery.

**5.5 Consequences for Failing to Meet Deadlines:**
The consequences for failing to meet deadlines will be determined by respective leads as well as the CEO(s) and SCRUM Master, in consultation with the affected team member(s).  
The consequences will be communicated clearly and fairly and will be designed to minimize the impact on the project's progress while ensuring that all team members are accountable for their work.

**5.6 Force Majeure:**
Team members will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to deliver the project due to events beyond their control, such as sickness, natural disasters, strikes, or school/government actions.
